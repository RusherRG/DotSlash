> Google Maps have changed the scope of navigation, it gives us the fastest route to a destination but it dosen't make sure that it is the safest route to reach your destination.

> Safely reached considers all the possible routes and gives you the shortest but also the **SAFEST** route for your journey.

> The `safest route` is chosen on the basis of the liveliness on a particular street like open restaurants,pharmacies,petrol pumps, hospitals etc.

> If it not possible to find a route with optimum level of safety there is an option to send an SOS alert to their close ones.
